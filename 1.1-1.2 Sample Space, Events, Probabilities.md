## 1.1-1.2 Sample Space, Events, Probabilities

### Sample Space (Ω)
- **Definition:** The set of all possible outcomes denoted as Ω.
- **Example:** For a single die roll, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

### Events (E)
- **Definition:** A subset of the sample space (E ⊆ Ω).
- **Example:** For even die rolls, E = {2, 4, 6}.
- **Example (single event):** If w = 1 belongs to Ω, then w ∈ Ω.

### Real-Valued Functions
- **Symbols:** R, F → IR (real-valued function).
- **Notations:** A, E ∈ F, A ⊆ Ω.

### Probability (P)
- **Axioms of Probability:**
  1. 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1 (axioms of probability).
  2. P(Ω) = 1, P(∅) = 0 (disjoint).
  3. If A₁, A₂, ... is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events, then P(A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ) = P(A₁) + P(A₂) + ... + P(Aₙ).
 
### Set Theory Review
- **Intersection (A ∩ B):** Both A and B occur (AND).
- **Union (A ∪ B):** At least one occurs (OR).
- **Complement (A^c):** A does not occur.
- **Subset (A ⊆ B):** Occurrence of A implies occurrence of B.
- **Mutually Exclusive/Disjoint:** No outcomes in common, don't occur at the same time (A ∩ B = ∅).

### Set Theory Rules (works for both intersection and union)
- A ∪ B = B ∪ A (commutative).
- (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C) (associative).
- (A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) (distributive).
- (A ∪ B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c (DeMorgan's Law).
