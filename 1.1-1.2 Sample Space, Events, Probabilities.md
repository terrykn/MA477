## 1.1-1.2 Sample Space, Events, Probabilities

### Sample Space (Ω)
- Definition: The set of all possible outcomes denoted as Ω.
- Example: For a single die roll, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

### Events (E)
- Definition: A subset of the sample space (E ⊆ Ω).
- Example: For even die rolls, E = {2, 4, 6}.
- Example (single event): If w = 1 belongs to Ω, then w ∈ Ω.

### Real-Valued Functions
- Symbols: R, F → IR (real-valued function).
- Notations: A, E ∈ F, A ⊆ Ω.

### Probability (P)
- Axioms of Probability:
  1. \(0 \leq P(A) \leq 1\) (axioms of probability).
  2. \(P(\Omega) = 1\), \(P(\varnothing) = 0\) (disjoint).
  3. If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots\) is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events, then \(P(A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \ldots + P(A_n)\).

### Set Theory Review
- Intersection (A ∩ B): Both A and B occur (AND).
- Union (A ∪ B): At least one occurs (OR).
- Complement (\(A^c\)): A does not occur.
- Subset (A ⊆ B): Occurrence of A implies occurrence of B.
- Mutually Exclusive/Disjoint: No outcomes in common, don't occur at the same time (A ∩ B = ∅).

### Set Theory Rules
- A ∪ B = B ∪ A (commutative).
- \((A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)\) (associative).
- \((A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)\) (distributive).
- \(A^c = A' \) (DeMorgan's Law).
